# TicTacToeBots
Bricks Dojo kata 1 - Paul van Cappelle

Hi! Do you want to play this game? It's Tic Tac Toe with two bots having a go at it against each other. They will try random moves to try to become the greatest of all time!

### How to use TicTacToeBots
TODO (you can run the main class, of course)

### Future features and improvements:
Let's have a chat together after you've played it. I'm very eager to learn if this is what you are looking for. Are we on the right track?
In any case, I suggest making the game a bit more interesting:
- Using a browser application to visualize the game
- allow the user to determine which player starts (X or O)
- allow setting the bots' level of play
- allow running a multitude of games in a row to see who really is the best bot, tournement style

### Future code improvements:
- I don't like the MutableList I had to use now, to be able to assign values easily withing the 'grid'
- (How to) test the output to the terminal is correct?
- Make swapPlayer a private function. Use a different way to be able to test it. Maybe just move it out of the TicTacToeBots class.

### First thoughts on looking at the assigment:
- Wait, but what tools should I use?
- How the hell can I do this in 2 hours?
- TTD? How does that even work? Write the test before even having a class and a function?
- OMG

### The process:
- I designed the architecture old school on a piece of paper, to get clear what classes I wanted/needed to create and their responsibilities.
- It ended up the way I designed it , but I realize I did not have a good plan upfront on to do this TTD. It was hard not to build things first. And I had to improvise with making the random moves when I got to that point. Didn't think that through at the start, but I think it made for a nice fake implementation of getting random potential moves.
- I took way too much time. At least 4 hours, including 45 minutes of pain to get things setup. My Git(hub) skills and working in IntelliJ (slightly different from Android Studio) failed me.
- And I haven't even delivered anything while writing this... pff
